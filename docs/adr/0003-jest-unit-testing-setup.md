# 3. Jest and Unit Testing Setup

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-09-25

## Context and Problem Statement

As the project grows, we need a robust testing strategy to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. Testing is essential for maintainable applications, especially when working in teams or when code will be maintained over time. We needed to choose testing tools that work well with Next.js, TypeScript, and our chosen development practices.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for automated testing to catch bugs early in development
- Requirement for testing tools that work seamlessly with Next.js App Router
- Integration with TypeScript for type-safe tests
- Support for testing React components in a way that reflects user behavior
- Fast feedback loop during development

## Considered Options

- **Option 1:** Jest + React Testing Library - Industry standard, excellent Next.js integration, focuses on testing user behavior
- **Option 2:** Vitest + Testing Library - Modern, fast, but less mature ecosystem for Next.js
- **Option 3:** Cypress for component testing - Great for integration tests, but overkill for unit tests

## Decision

We decided to adopt **Option 1: Jest + React Testing Library**:

1. **Core Testing Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. **Configuration Files:**
   - `jest.config.ts` - Main Jest configuration with Next.js integration
   - `jest.setup.ts` - Global test setup and custom matchers
   - `moduleNameMapper` to handle our `@/` path aliases

3. **Testing Conventions:**
   - Test files: `*.test.tsx` located next to the component they test
   - Focus on testing user behavior rather than implementation details
   - Use the "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern for test structure

4. **NPM Script:**
   ```json
   "test": "jest --watch"
   ```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Automated testing provides confidence when refactoring code
- React Testing Library encourages testing from the user's perspective
- Jest watch mode provides immediate feedback during development
- Excellent integration with Next.js and TypeScript
- Large community and extensive documentation

### Negative

- Additional complexity and learning curve for developers new to testing
- Test setup requires understanding of multiple tools working together
- Initial configuration can be tricky (module aliases, jsdom environment)
