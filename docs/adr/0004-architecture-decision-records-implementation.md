# 4. Implementation of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Date:** 2025-09-25

## Context and Problem Statement

As software projects grow in complexity, it becomes crucial to document not just what was built, but why certain technical decisions were made. The "Context Engineering" approach emphasizes capturing the reasoning, constraints, and trade-offs behind architectural choices. Without proper documentation, future developers (including our future selves) struggle to understand the rationale behind technical decisions, leading to poor modifications or unnecessary rewrites.

## Decision Drivers

- Need to apply "Context Engineering" principles to maintain project knowledge
- Requirement to document the reasoning behind technical decisions, not just the decisions themselves
- Importance of helping future contributors understand the "why" behind the codebase
- Creating a knowledge base that survives team changes and time

## Considered Options

- **Option 1:** Inline code comments only - Simple but gets scattered and hard to find
- **Option 2:** Wiki or external documentation - Can become outdated and disconnected from code
- **Option 3:** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the repository - Living documentation that stays with the code

## Decision

We decided to implement **Option 3: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**:

1. **Structure:**
   - Location: `docs/adr/` directory in the project root
   - Naming: `NNNN-title-in-kebab-case.md`
   - Template: Standardized format with Context, Decision Drivers, Options, Decision, and Consequences

2. **Process:**
   - Create an ADR for each significant technical decision
   - Include both the chosen solution and rejected alternatives with reasoning
   - Update status (Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated) as decisions evolve

3. **Integration:**
   - Reference ADRs in the main README.md
   - Link to relevant ADRs in code comments when appropriate

## Consequences

### Positive

- Future developers can understand the reasoning behind current architecture
- Helps avoid repeating past debates and decisions
- Creates institutional knowledge that survives team changes
- Encourages more thoughtful decision-making by forcing documentation of rationale
- Provides context for future architectural evolution

### Negative

- Additional overhead when making technical decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain documentation
- Risk of ADRs becoming outdated if not actively maintained
